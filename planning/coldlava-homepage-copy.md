Custom software, AI agents, and automation for companies done with off-the-shelf compromises.

## 3. Services — "What we build"

**Section headline:**
Systems that work around your business

**Section subhead:**
We build software and automation tailored to how you actually operate — not how a product manager in San Francisco thinks you should.

---

### Service 1: Custom Software

**Title:** Business systems built to spec

**Description:**
CRMs, platforms, and internal tools designed around your workflows. No adapting your business to fit the software.

---

### Service 2: AI Agents

## 4. BOS Section

**Eyebrow:** Coming 2026

**Headline:**
BOS — Business Operating System

**Thesis line:**
We built BOS because CRMs are broken.

**Body copy:**
Most business software forces you to work around its limitations. BOS is different — an AI-native operating system designed for how modern businesses actually run.

**Bullets:**
- Not another CRM. A complete operating system.
- AI built in from the start, not bolted on.
- One system instead of twelve integrations.
- Built for operators, not administrators.

**CTA:** Join the waitlist

**Supporting line under CTA:**
For operators done stitching together tools that don't talk to each other.

## 6. How We Work

**Section headline:**
No surprises. No black boxes.

**Section subhead:**
Every project follows a clear structure — whether it's a two-week automation or a six-month platform build.

---

### Step 1: Diagnose

**Description:**
We start by understanding your business, not just your requirements. What's working, what's broken, what's costing you time and money.

---

### Step 2: Design

**Description:**
You get a clear scope, timeline, and cost before we write a line of code. No ambiguity, no scope creep surprises.

---

### Step 3: Build

**Description:**
We build in short cycles with regular check-ins. You see progress weekly, not after three months of silence.

---

### Step 4: Support

**Description:**
Launch isn't the end. We stick around to optimise, fix issues, and evolve the system as your business grows.

---

## 7. Tech & Trust

**Section headline:**
Modern stack. Serious security.

**Section subhead:**
We build with tools that are fast, reliable, and built to scale — not legacy systems held together with duct tape.

**Tech logos to display:**
- Next.js
- Supabase
- n8n
- Vercel
- GitHub
- TypeScript
- OpenAI / Anthropic

**Trust copy (optional):**
UK-based. GDPR-aware. Your data stays yours.

# Alternative Hero Options

If the main hero doesn't land, here are variations to test:

**Option A — Outcome-first:**
> Intelligent systems for businesses that refuse to settle
> 
> Custom software, AI agents, and automation — built around how you work, not how software thinks you should.

**Option B — Problem-aware:**
> Your software shouldn't hold your business back
> 
> We build custom systems that adapt to you — not the other way around.

**Option C — Direct and simple:**
> Custom software and AI for serious businesses
> 
> We build the systems you can't buy off the shelf.

**Option D — BOS-led:**
> The software your business deserves doesn't exist yet
> 
> So we're building it. And until then, we'll build yours.

# Copy Notes

**Word count by section:**
- Hero: ~30 words
- Services: ~150 words total
- BOS: ~100 words
- Case studies: ~200 words total
- How we work: ~120 words
- About: ~100 words
- Contact: ~40 words

**Total homepage copy: ~750 words**

This is intentionally lean. High-ticket sites say less, not more. Every line should earn its place.

**Placeholders to fill:**
- Proof band stats (need real numbers)
- Case study specifics (need actual outcomes)
- Client logos (need permissions)
- Founder photos

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Does every section answer one buyer question?
- [ ] Are outcomes specific and believable?
- [ ] Does anything sound like marketing fluff?
- [ ] Would you say this to someone on a sales call?
- [ ] Is there anything you can cut?
